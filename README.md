This project aims to develop a model to predict the price of smartwatches. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/smart-watch-prices.
After EDA, cleaning, and feature engineering the battery life variable, a multi linear regression model with and without regularisation is fitted.
